                Most people with the flu do not need medical care or antiviral drugs.
                In most cases, itâ€™s best to stay home and avoid contact with other
                people. If you have other health problems or are very sick or are
                worried about your illness, you should contact your health care provider.

                Some people are at high risk for serious flu-related complications,
                such as needing to go to the hospital or having trouble breathing because
                of pneumonia.

                <b>If you are in one of these high-risk groups, please contact your provider today </b>
                 to discuss your symptoms and discuss if you need to be examined.  You should also
                discuss whether you would benefit from antiviral medicines.  Antiviral medicines
                help the most when started within 2 days after symptoms begin. For people with other
                medical problems, antivirals may need to be started even if it has been longer than
                2 days after symptoms began.
