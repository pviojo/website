                Your research test is positive for <Bold>Enterovirus</Bold>, a virus that
                mostly causes mild symptoms, including fever, runny nose, sneezing,
                cough, and body and muscle aches. Some people may have a skin rash

                Most people with enterovirus infections do not need medical care,
                and recover in a week or two. In most cases, itâ€™s best to stay home
                and avoid contact with other people.
