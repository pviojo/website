                Your research test is positive for <Bold>Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection (RSV)</Bold>,
                a virus that causes a respiratory infection that can be spread from person to person.

                Most people with RSV do not need medical care and get better in a week or two.
                In most cases, itâ€™s best to stay home while you are sick, and avoid contact with
                other people.
