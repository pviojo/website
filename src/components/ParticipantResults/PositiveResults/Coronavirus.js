                Your research test is positive for <Bold>Coronavirus</Bold><sup>*</sup>, a type of
                virus that causes respiratory infections that can be spread from person to person.
                This infection is usually mild, like the common cold, or moderate, with flu-like
                symptoms. Symptoms can include fever, runny nose, congestion, cough, and sore throat.

                Most people with Coronavirus infections do not need medical care, and recover in a
                week or two. In most cases, itâ€™s best to stay home and avoid contact with other people.

                Certain people are at higher risk for severe Coronavirus infections, including
                older adults, people with chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised individuals.
                In these groups of people, Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia and exacerbations of
                asthma or chronic bronchitis.
